Hence, the root is modeled as a porous medium, where the root xylem is the pore space filled with water and all other root components constitute the solid matrix. The type of model is chosen by including the right header file in the problem file, with ```#include <dumux/porousmediumflow/1p/model.hh>```. Additionally, the spatial parameter class is derived from a suitable base class, i.e. ```FVSpatialParamsOneP```.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We use TimeLoop.CheckTimes and only write vtk files at the check times\n",

    "2. The model is static and we always build a static model. But we use the simulation loop to use dynamic boundary conditions like a sinusoidal transpiration rate.\n",
